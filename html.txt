Q-4:What are HTML Entities? With Example.
Ans:HTML entities are special codes used to represent reserved characters, as well as characters that may not easily be typed or rendered in HTML documents. These entities begin with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;). HTML entities are particularly useful when you want to display characters that have special meanings in HTML, such as <, >, or &, without actually triggering their respective HTML tags.
    examples of HTML entities:
    1.Less Than (<) and Greater Than (>) Symbols:
        '<' is represented by '&lt';
        '>' is represented by '&gt';
    Example:
           <p>This is an example of '&lt';'p&gt'; tag.</p>
    2.Ampersand (&) Symbol:
        '&' is represented by &amp;
    Example:
           <p>This &amp; that</p>
